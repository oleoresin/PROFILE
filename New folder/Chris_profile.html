            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">I was born and raised in the state of New Hampshire where I spent my first year of college studying construction and Computer Aided Drawing (CAD).  After my first few semesters I ended up going to work, starting in retail services and eventually outdoor manual labor jobs.  I ended up moving from home about 5 years ago and packed up for the south.  I have been living in Georgia ever since and in that time completed my bachelors' degree online with Liberty University, got married, and found a full time job working for a steel fabrication company as a Machine Operator II.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Although my job is secure and I enjoy what I do I am looking to further my experiences and abilties by learning web development.  Over the past 2 years through online bootcamps and company-sponsored LinkedIn Learning training videos I have been trying to learn and grow in the field and I look forward to new opportunities to come.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <div>
            Photographer - Portraits
            2020-2021
            <p>
                I worked with the Lifetouch Photography Company owned by Shutterfly. While there, I learned how to work a camera, camera equipment, set up an entire photo studio consisting of over 15 pieces, and pose people for portraits. The people I worked with were all school age, ranging from preschool to high school.
                The workload was heavy and you had to move fast, so I developed the skill to work fast under pressure while also making sure the lighting and posing were perfect. Also while working for Lifetouch, I was able to speak to directors, principals, and executives in order to make sure our days ran smoothly without interruption or confusion.
                The work was fun and energetic and I enjoyed it very much as well as enjoying the people I met.

            <p>
                As a teacher, I am able to create curriculum that includes learning activities that are heavily based in art. I continue to use my passion for creating with all the children I work with, hoping to encourage and inspire them to continue creating art.
                As a teacher, I also receive many projects and drawings from my students. I keep all of them. I even have a few hanging on my wall at home. I love displaying the creations that were inspired by my teaching. It creates a sense of pride in myself as well as motivating me when I am feeling uninspired.
